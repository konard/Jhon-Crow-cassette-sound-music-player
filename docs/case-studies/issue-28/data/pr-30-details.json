These collision boxes:\n- Are completely invisible (transparent material with visible: false)\n- Extend the clickable area above, below, and around each button\n- Share the same button type userData, so they trigger the same actions\n- Make touch targets much more forgiving on mobile devices\n\n## 📝 Implementation Details\n\n**File Modified:** `src/renderer.js`\n\nChanges made in the `createCassettePlayer()` function:\n1. Added collision box geometry for each of the 4 control buttons (prev, play, stop, next)\n2. Added collision box for the play button's red dot indicator\n3. Each collision box is positioned at the same location as its corresponding visual button\n4. All collision boxes have `userData.isButton = true` and the appropriate `buttonType` for proper raycasting detection\n\n## 🧪 Testing\n\nThe solution was verified by:\n- Reviewing the button creation code and collision detection logic\n- Ensuring collision boxes are properly registered for raycasting\n- Confirming the visual appearance remains unchanged (collision boxes are invisible)\n- Verifying that both desktop and mobile click/touch handlers will detect these larger hit areas\n\n## 💡 Technical Notes\n\n- The visual buttons remain the same size - only the clickable area is enlarged\n- The collision boxes use `MeshBasicMaterial` with `visible: false` for zero rendering cost\n- The approach works for both mouse clicks (desktop) and touch events (mobile)\n- No changes to the raycasting logic were needed - the existing system automatically detects the larger collision boxes\n\n---\n*This PR was created automatically by the AI issue
